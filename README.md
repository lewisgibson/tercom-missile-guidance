This repository showcases sophisticated C++ implementations of trajectory guidance calculations for cruise missiles, specifically focusing on topographic reconnaissance.

## TERCOM

The utilization of TERCOM, distinguished for its exceptional precision stemming from the radar altimeter/contour map integration, offers substantial advantages over INS. By enabling the missile to navigate in closer proximity to obstacles and maintain lower altitudes, TERCOM enhances the stealth capability, rendering detection by ground radar considerably more challenging.
